# Exercises:

    Tab, Space, or Newlines. Go doesn't _really_ care about whitespace.

    Any line prefixed with `//` or surrounded by `/*  */`. These are ignored during compilation.

3. Our program began with package main. What would the files in the fmt package begin with?
    The files in the fmt package would begin with `package fmt`. 

4. We used the Println function defined in the fmt package. If you wanted to use the Exit function from the os package, what would you need to do?
    Add `import os` under the `import fmt` line. 

5. Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing Hello, World it prints Hello, my name is followed by your name.
