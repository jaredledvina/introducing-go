1. What does the following program print?
```
i := 10
if i > 10 {
    fmt.Println("Big")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Small")
}
```

The program will output, Small.

2. Write a program that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 that are evenly divisible by 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9, etc.).

See exercise_2.go

3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print “Buzz.” For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz.”
See exercise_3.go
